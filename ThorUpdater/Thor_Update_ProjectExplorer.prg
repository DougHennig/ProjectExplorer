Project Manager: Doug Hennig

Project Explorer is a VFPX project that replaces the Project Manager with a modern interface and modern capabilities. It has most of the features of the Project Manager but adds integration with DVCS (including built-in support for FoxBin2PRG and optional auto-commit after changes), support for multiple projects within a "solution," allows you to organize your items by keyword or other criteria, and has support for easy "auto-registering" addins that can customize the appearance and behavior of the tool.
