- Show it supports all Project Manager features (show in collapsed view)
	- support for Tools, Options setting: UseContainerIcon, ProjectClick
- Show new features
- Add Noisy projecthook to project and show it immediately takes effect + show that projecthook events are supported
- Solution: different build settings for different projects (want Demo2 built to DLL)
- Support for all project, class, and other items settings including Description and User (Icon for classes which according to help for AVCXCLASSES are supposed to be supported in Project Manager but aren't)
- Edit TestBeforeLoadTreeView addin and make it active. Run Project Explorer, change color of a file, then click Reload to show nodes sorted by category

- Demo: run D:\Project Explorer Demo\Demo\ResetVC.bat to reset version control

- Projecthooks supported but addins more powerful, easier to create and install, and more of them

Functionality
=============

- Inconsistency: projecthook QueryNewFile fires for new connection (and other things in DBC) but QueryModifyFile doesn't. Project Explorer does the same


Project Manager bugs
====================

- Files.Add for an EXE adds it as "x" instead of "Z": ProjectOperations.AddItem takes care of that

- Files.Add: a VCX is set to the main file when added if there is no main file for the project (this is a throwback to the days when ActiveDoc was supported). ProjectOperations.AddItem takes care of that

- Files.Add for table in a DBC returns the file object for the DBC. PJX adds table when include it in project but can't do it using project methods, so ProjectItemTableInDBC.SaveItem hacks the PJX file

- Turning off main file for project: MainFile is r/o and while Project.SetMain('') works, it returns .F. and doesn't clear MainFile until project closed and reopened

- File.Run works from Command window but not in code so have to manually run item (e.g. ProjectItemForm.RunItem
